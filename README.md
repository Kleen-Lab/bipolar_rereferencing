# Public code repository for the Journal of Engineering manuscript "Distance of bipolar re-referencing imparts nonlinear frequency-specific influences on intracranial recording signal measurements"

================================

## Package setup. 

### 1. Required software 
MATLAB (tested with Version 2023-2025)  
R (tested with version 4.4)
Python (version 3)

### 2. Other dependencies 
None

### 3. Installation
To install the package and have a copy of the code to edit locally, navigate to where you would like to store the package code in your terminal. Clone the package.

```https://github.com/Kleen-Lab/bipolar_rereferencing.git```

Note that you will have to configure paths in the code to wherever your data is stored. Recommended to store data folder in same location as this repository.   

### 4. Download data

Download data from : [10.17605/OSF.IO/CN8W4](https://osf.io/cn8w4/)

and place in ```data/``` subfolder in the main working directory. 

## Files of interest 

Run the ```master_bipolar_2025.m``` file to generate all analyses and figures. Information to run all analysis and plots is included in the master_script and the functions it calls.

The supplementary figure 1 requires python and R to recreate . Refer to ```supp_figure_1_stats.R``` and ```bipolar_supplementary1.py```. 

The ```helpers``` folder has the associated helper functions that the scripts call to generate the analyses and figures.
